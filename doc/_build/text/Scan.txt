scans.go_to_hkl(h, k, l)

   Provided proper configuration (setting up lattice, ub, azimuthal
   parameters, this function calculates and moves to motors to given
   hkl coordiantes.

   **Return type:** None

   **h:** h coordinate in reciprocal space

   **k:** k coordinate in reciprocal space

   **l:** l coordinate in reciprocal space

scans.scan_hkl(h, k, l, stepsize)

   Given hkl coordinates and resolution, scan_hkl() performs scan in
   reciprocal space. h,k,l values can be single values(i.e.
   0,1,1.3,..) as well as python Lists with start and end points [1,2]
   The resolution denotes the intervals scan is performed across. For
   given h=[1,2] and stepsize=0.2 scan will be performed across
   1,1.2,1.4,...,2 For each trajectory, a
   checkTrajectory(Trajectory=,Steps=) routine is called in order to
   make sure calculated values are valid.Users also have access to
   this function. Once generateTrajectory() is called, one can call
   checkTraj() in order to make sure calculations are correct. This is
   quite useful for complex coordinates and crystal orientations.

   **return type :** None

   **h:** h values h=[h_init,h_final] OR h=fixed_h

   **k:** k values k=[k_init,k_final] OR k=fixed_k

   **l:** l values l=[l_init,l_final] OR l=fixed_l

   **stepsize:** Step size for the interval between initial and final
   values of h,k,l
