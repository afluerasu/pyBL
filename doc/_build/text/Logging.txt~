Logging
*******

This API provides two forms of logging: Automatic (hardware and
configuration requirements and critical parameters for Scripting
Environment to operate) and User Defined.


Automatic Logging
=================

This package provides hardware control in an NSLS2 beamlines using
some EPICS tools: python-cothread and IOC. Given such control,users
have more direct and recordable interaction with  their beamline
experimental setup. As some of the variables, which  users have access
to, directly affect the outcome of their experiment,this service
identifies and logs these critical parameters for debugging and data
processing purposes that might emerge in the future. Some of these
parameters include: sample orientation, diffraction type, diffraction
geometry,user/experiment owner name, timestamp, information regarding
detector data, scan parameters (scan type,motor velocity during a
scan,reciprocal space position of the sample),temperature, default
paths of the scan files,etc...


User Defined Logging
====================

In order to provide users with complete experimental logging
capability, this package allows users to define their own logging
functions within the API. This sort of logging depends heavily on
experiment type. For instance, during an XRAY diffraction experiment,
that deals with 4S+2D diffractometers, motor positions and their
relationship to reciprocal space coordinates have to be
recorded.However, a continous scan experiment that is done in order to
determine region of interest does not have such requirement. This
allows users to compose customized experimental logs based on their
experiment type.
