Project Description:
===================
  National Synchrotron Light Source 2 will be replacing BNL's current light source NSLS. NSLS2 is a state of the art, medium-energy electron storage rin(3 billion EV). This command line application and its API provides a Python scripting environment for NSLS2 beamlines.Users can generate their own macros, configurations for hardware control and data processing in the beamlines.This version of the software is primarily for XRay diffraction beamlines with 6 circles (4S+2D).
